# Road Navigation System

## Overview

The **Road Navigation System** is a mini project developed using Flask, NetworkX, and OpenRouteService. This application allows users to find the distance between two locations and provides a visual representation of the route on a map. It utilizes the A* search algorithm for pathfinding and integrates with the OpenRouteService API to fetch real-world distances and coordinates.

## Features

- **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two specified locations.
- **Route Visualization**: Display the route on an interactive map using Folium.
- **A* Pathfinding**: Implement the A* search algorithm to find the optimal path between locations.
- **Geocoding**: Convert city names into geographical coordinates using the OpenRouteService Geocoding API.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python.
- **NetworkX**: A Python library for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks.
- **Folium**: A Python library used for visualizing data on an interactive map.
- **OpenRouteService**: An API for routing and geocoding services.
